A site where trusted reviewers can write reviews about films, other users can rate the reviews and talk about the reviews and the films. Trusted reviewer accounts can be seeded. Regular user accounts are done via sign-up.

Key features/User stories:
- has users and authentication, some of whom are “trusted reviewers”
- has a public list of films
- each film has some reviews written only by trusted reviewers
- films belong to categories
- should be able to see the latest reviews, and the latest reviews by category
- users should be able to rate and comment on reviews
- users should be able to rate and comment on films

Stretch ideas:
- admin access for reviewers on comments left on their reviews
actors in films, and reviews for actors
- Instead of being seeded, trusted reviewers can be invited to sign up by being sent special e-mail links that allow them to create an account as a trusted reviewer.
